**BRETTOS — SECOND BRAIN (July 22 — see SECOND_BRAIN_QUERY_BUILD_BRIEF_v1.0; CAP-028 #2 / CAP-015 / CAP-024)**
- B-133 · 🟠 Second Brain — **multi-role Ask agent** (v1.2): PIN-gated `ask.html` (EN/ES) + `POST /ask` (direct Worker call, NOT a Cowork session). **P0 = identity-scoped authorization.** v1 roles = **admin + vendor + owner + tenant** (driver designed-for but DEFERRED, low-pri). Each asker scoped to its allow-set (vendor: own WOs + assigned-property codes + own pay; owner: own properties/WOs/billing; tenant: own unit + WO status + tenant-shareable codes only). FACT (scoped Sheets) / SEMANTIC (Audience-filtered Brain, **LOCKED default**) / CAPTURE. Read+capture only; audit every sensitive answer. Seed Brain now. `Drop_Locations` = empty seam (low-pri bolt-on). Seed of Brett's vendor/driver/owner/tenant assistant (ties vendor.html, owner/tenant portals, B-055, B-132). Brief: `SECOND_BRAIN_QUERY_BUILD_BRIEF_v1.2`.
- B-134 · 🟠 Self-writing brain — nightly agent fills the `Brain` tab (chunks + freshness tags) and syncs the `Capture` tab → repo `CAPTURE_INBOX.md`. Makes "effortless growth" real; is CAP-024. The ingestion loop the phone reads. Ties B-124 (scan agent), B-103 (intake engine), B-123 (background agents).
- B-135 · 🟡 LEARNED.md valet-memory — every Brett correction becomes a `Brain` chunk (Source=learned) so the assistant retains nuance/exceptions (#257 "shirts need light starch"). Generalizes the HANDWRITING_KEY live-learning pattern to all domains.
- B-136 · 🟡 ⏳ SMS door for the brain — once Twilio is fixed, an inbound route calls the same `handleAsk`; caller-ID whitelist = auth; adds "reply MORE" + dictated MMS voice notes (finishes B-052). Blocked on Twilio setup fix.
- B-137 · 🟠 **Near-term notification stopgap (pre-Twilio)** — split delivery by recipient: **email auto-sends** (owners + email-capable tenants, via Gmail connector) NOW; **SMS = a Hub "Send Queue"** where the system composes each message (recipient + text + language) and Brett **one-taps to send from the number they already know** (`sms:` prefill for personal-number contacts; copy+open-thread for GV). AI does 100% of composing; Brett is the send button. **GV auto-send RULED OUT (verified July 22): no Google Voice send API; email-reply only works replying to inbound; 3rd-party email→SMS = paid middleman (skip).** Clean bridge to Twilio: same queue + templates flip to auto-send later. Ties B-093 (channel-tiering), B-133 (two-way owner/vendor lane).
- B-138 · 🟠 **Contact channel map** — add per-contact fields on Vendors/Tenants/Owners: `Brett_Number_Known` (personal / google_voice), `Preferred_Channel` (sms/email), `Lang`. Prerequisite for B-137 (which link to generate + who needs the intro) AND for Twilio later + the B-133 language pref. Known: **Mark & Amanda = GV; Jennifer & Adrian = personal;** rest = Brett fills in.
- B-139 · 🟡 **Vendor "Ridge Co line" intro** — one-time staggered message introducing the GV number as Brett's Ridge Co/dispatch line (NOT "reach me for most things" — framed as the job line so it stays honest when the assistant later sends codes/pay from it). EN + **ES (P0)** drafts done (July 22). **Only personal-number contacts get it** (Mark/Amanda already on GV). Send individually/staggered (GV daily limits + anti-spam). Gated on B-138.
**BRETTOS — AUTONOMY SUBSTRATE (July 23 — the safe path to autonomous multi-section builds; see CAP-029)**
- B-140 · 🟠 **Staging/preview Worker lane (autonomy prerequisite #1 — ISOLATION).** A genuinely isolated preview target so autonomous/risky code NEVER runs on the live Hub. Fix is the July 21 lesson (FEATURE_LOG rule 18): non-prod deploy command = `wrangler versions upload` → *preview URL*, never `wrangler deploy`. Until this exists, "Builds for non-production branches" stays OFF and no agent merges unattended. This is the gate everything else on the ladder sits behind.
- B-141 · 🟠 **Smoke-test harness (autonomy prerequisite #2 — SELF-VERIFICATION).** A script that curls every critical endpoint (list from CODEMAP) and asserts the expected JSON — the machine's stand-in for "Brett taps the app." Encode FEATURE_LOG regression rules as assertions where possible. Without this an agent literally cannot know it broke something. Runs against the B-140 preview lane.
- B-142 · 🟠 **ridgeco-validate skill (autonomy prerequisite #3 — REVIEW GATE).** Adversarial built-vs-brief validator; the missing 7th "software-factory" role. Reports gaps by severity, fixes nothing; mandatory for money/customer/auth. ✅ **DELIVERED July 23 (this session) as `ridgeco-validate.skill`** — save it. Wire into brett-flow as the step-5.5 gate.
- B-143 · 🟡 **Autonomy ladder (the governing strategy doc).** Blast-radius-gated staging: autonomy is EARNED per-section by rails (isolation + smoke + validator), never granted globally. Money/QB/customer-comms/auth stay human-gated by design. Ties B-127 router ("force Claude for money-facing" → extend to "force human"), B-129 Optimizer (validator verdicts = telemetry), CAP-029.
**BRETTOS — QUALITY LAYER (July 23 — the "not-broken is a FLOOR, quality is the CEILING" upgrade; see CAP-029)**
_The 5 verbs: DEFINE what good is → TEST for it positively → REVIEW against it → MEASURE it in prod → CALIBRATE the bar._
- B-144 · 🟠 **Quality Bar / Definition-of-Done rubric (DEFINE — the missing quality parameter).** Per change-class checklists of what "good" means beyond "it works": Worker endpoint (idempotent, auth-tagged, telemetry-logged, standard error shape, no N+1 sheet reads, WO-by-header-name); Hub screen (Status SSOT, one button system, mobile tap targets, EN/ES parity, loading/empty/error states); money change (penny-correct, no double-post, reconciles to QB). This is what ridgeco-validate and the reviewer score against. Foundational — build first.
- B-145 · 🟠 **Golden-path scenario tests + seeded fixture dataset (TEST positively).** Smoke = "endpoint answers 200"; golden = "create WO → assign → bill → approve → QB posts correct amount → status flips to Paid." End-to-end business-outcome assertions on the B-140 preview lane, run against a SEEDED test Sheet/tenant so autonomous runs never touch real records (also closes the "single live DB" blocker). 
- B-146 · 🟠 **Quality-reviewer agent (REVIEW — second lens beyond ridgeco-validate).** Validator = "matches the brief"; reviewer = "is it GOOD" — a multi-lens panel (correctness / security / SSOT-consistency / mobile-UX / i18n / data-integrity), higher effort for money/customer code. Adopts the "software-factory" security-reviewer + accessibility-reviewer roles as rubric lenses.
- B-147 · 🟡 **Quality KPIs into the Optimizer (MEASURE — quality you can't see isn't quality).** Post-deploy signals: error rate + p95 latency per endpoint, QB reconciliation drift, **Brett-corrections-per-feature**, vendor task-completion rate, EN/ES coverage %. Feed B-128 telemetry spine → B-129 Optimizer so a feature that ships clean but creates support pain SHOWS UP. Ties PAT-032.
- B-148 · 🟡 **Canary rollout + automated rollback (MEASURE/safety).** Even after gates pass: deploy behind a flag / to a canary slice, watch the B-147 KPIs for N hours, auto-rollback on threshold breach. Automates the rule-18 manual `main` force-redeploy. Reversibility = a quality property.
- B-149 · 🟡 **House-style consistency checks (REVIEW — the no-framework linter).** Encode conventions as checks since there's no framework: every endpoint uses the auth helper, resolves WO by header name (rule-6 bug), uses QB_TRADE_MAP, returns the standard error shape, conforms to Status SSOT. Directly attacks the UX-audit rot (status defined ~22 ways, 5 button systems).
- B-150 · 🟡 **Quality-gate policy + Brett spot-check sampling (CALIBRATE — the teeth).** Merge thresholds by blast radius (money = 100% rubric + human; internal tooling = auto-merge at ≥Nq score). Plus 1-in-N Brett spot-review even of auto-merged work so the bar stays calibrated to his taste and agents don't drift. Ties the autonomy ladder (B-143).
- B-153 · 🟠 **Priority engine + "Stalled & costing you" (the panel's brain — from CAP-030).** Makes the Command Center actually prioritize: (1) **venture switch/filter** (pick a venture → its own ranked list; "next step" distills per venture); (2) **per-venture #1 next step always shown** so nothing hides under Ridge Co's volume; (3) **ranking = who's-waiting-on-Brett (primary weight) + deadline proximity + dollars/opportunity-cost at stake** — Ridge Co floats up because someone's always waiting, but a hard deadline with real money (BarrelCo Fri drop) jumps the line; (4) **"Stalled & costing you" surface** — items blocked on a dependency (esp. cross-venture like Fleet↔BarrelCo), with days-blocked + running $ estimate; the surface that would've caught the 2-week BarrelCo truck bottleneck early. Ties B-151 (renders here), B-016, B-051, B-072, CAP-007. ✅ panel v3 mockup delivered July 23 (venture chips + per-venture next step + stalled-cost card). ❓ auto-compute the $ cost (needs $/day rate) or just days-blocked + manual $ tag first (rec: latter).
- B-152 · 🟠 **Scoped sandbox for money paths (extends B-140/B-145 — decided, NOT a new pillar).** Brett's Q: does a test-customer/test-vendor/test-Sheet system add value or is it overkill given B-140 (preview Worker) + B-145 (seeded test Sheet)? **Verdict: ~70% already covered.** The test Sheet = B-145; the isolated runtime = B-140. The ONE real gap his idea surfaces = the **QuickBooks side**, and the correct mechanism is NOT test entities in the LIVE QB company (realm 9130355695406136 — that pollutes real books/reconciliation/taxes — AVOID). Instead: (a) **mock QB by default** for most tests (assert the correct payload/amount/account without calling QB); (b) use **Intuit's free QB Sandbox company** for the money-path golden tests only (real create→invoice→pay→reconcile against isolated fake books); (c) formalize a **hard "sandbox mode" flag** on the preview Worker so it is STRUCTURALLY unable to write to the live Sheet or live QB (config-pointed at test targets + a kill-switch blocking prod identifiers) — turns "we're careful" into "it can't, by construction." **Scope to money/QB/customer paths ONLY** — for UI/capture/non-money changes, B-145's test Sheet already suffices; adding more there IS the overkill Brett rightly wants to avoid. Payoff: the highest-stakes path (money→books) arrives at Brett's approval already exercised end-to-end = a real score jump, not ceremony. From CAP-029.
- B-151 · 🔴 **Control Panel / "Check Everything" surface (THE keystone — Brett can't read code).** **Scope EXPANDED July 23 → full COMMAND CENTER, not just build approvals.** Adds a **Today** home tab: what's open / important / next ACROSS ALL VENTURES (money owed, admin, fleet, cabin, CHEP) with the single next action up top — absorbs/unifies B-016 (multi-venture dashboard) + B-051 (daily digest) into the one surface Brett already trusts. **LIVING SURFACE — STANDING DIRECTIVE (Brett, July 23):** the Control Panel is continuously refined whenever new insight/opportunity surfaces, NOT only on data events (emails, etc.). Owned by the Optimizer loop (B-129, PAT-032); every session that finds a panel improvement should propose/apply it. Refinements so far: v2 command-center Today tab; v3 venture switch/filter + per-venture #1 next step + "Stalled & costing you" (B-153); v4 harder-to-fumble rollback (standout EMERGENCY button, centered/inset, two-step checkbox-then-confirm) + small $ cost tags on stalled items. Mockup iterated to v5 (rollback moved to top under health banner). ✅ **Phase-0 READ-ONLY slice SHIPPED July 23** = `command-center.html`, wired to live Ridge Co endpoints, no worker.js change (zero risk); Approve/rollback disabled until the substrate. See `BUILD_ORDER_v1.0.md` (LOCKED) + FEATURE_LOG v1.9. Next per locked order: Phase 1 preview lane (B-140). The human-facing translation layer that makes the whole quality+autonomy stack usable by a non-coder: every gate/test/KPI rendered as plain-English checks + an approve/reject decision. Brett is the APPROVER, not the inspector — like reading an inspection report, never source. Screens: (1) Hub Health (smoke suite → "5 core jobs working"), (2) **Needs You** approval queue (each staged build = plain summary + quality report card + "how I checked it" + Preview/Approve/Send-back), (3) Did-For-You (autonomous low-risk log), (4) Watch List (KPIs in English incl. Brett-corrections-per-feature + EN/ES coverage), (5) one-tap **Roll back to this morning**. Mobile-first, Fairfax look. ✅ **Interactive MOCKUP delivered July 23** (`brettos-control-panel.html`) — awaiting Brett feedback before it graduates to a live build wired to real data. This is what B-144..150 report INTO; without it the quality layer is invisible to Brett. Reframes B-150 (his spot-check/approval happens HERE).

| B-073 | 🟠 | Properties onboarding site for customers (add properties; CSV import) | Multiple inputs / CSV. From CAP-018. |
| B-075 | 🟡 | Upgrade Hub UI to match the 4518 Fairfax Rd estimate look | Brett's UI baseline. From CAP-018. |
| B-077 | 🟡 | Preventive-maintenance package | Ties B-072 standards engine + CAP-010. From CAP-018. |
| B-082 | 🟠 | Cesar mirror site — tracks his own jobs separately but includes Brett's | Vendor-portal extension. Ties CAP-010. From CAP-018. |
| B-084 | 🟠 | Hub "Receipts to file" queue — OCR + classify + seeded WO/property picker → post (preview-first) | Confirm-first. 3 categories: customer WO-materials (billable), owned-property expense (e.g. 1864 Kerns STR), business expense ("BMore"). Read hand-written property/WO/"BMore" first → else learned vendor-default (seed: Advance Auto→BMore) → else ask. Customer-charge check; no double-billing. All → QB + filed to Vendors drive. From CAP-002. |
| B-085 | 🟠 | Rebuild receipt intake pipeline — retire the stalled Make.com scenario | Diagnosed July 19: "WO Receipt Inbox" (id 1BpJXcOlW98…) has 10+ receipts stuck since Aug–Dec 2025; Make.com watch→email→move is dead. Replace with Hub pipeline (B-084): QB posting via the connected API + Apps Script file moves. From CAP-002. |
| B-086 | 🟡 | Reconcile receipts stuck in "WO Receipt Inbox" (Aug–Dec 2025) | 10+ PDFs never processed; confirm which already reached QuickBooks, record/attach the rest, then file by vendor. From CAP-002. |
| B-088 | 🟡 | Add 1864 Kerns School Rd (owned STR) to the WO system as a property | For expense tracking; its STR expenses usually have no WO but should apply to the property. From CAP-002. |

## RIDGE CO — OPERATIONS / TO-DO
*(Operational to-dos captured from Brett's notes — not builds. Source: CAP-012, CAP-014.)*

| ID | Priority | Item | Notes |

| B-035 | 🟠 | Follow up with Cesar (Mon) on the 56 S Culver St job | Cesar got the Culver job (V-003). Written note read "Oscar Culver," but it went to Cesar. |
| B-036 | 🟢 | Confirm $300 extra to Cesar (V-003) for 807 N Calvert St bakery floor prep is booked in QB | Legit per Brett — floor repairs were needed before the install (807 N Calvert St bakery, NOT Culver). Owed, not an overpay. |

| B-049 | 🟠 | Pay Sergio — bills entered, needs paid | Sergio = vendor. From CAP-014. |
| B-050 | 🟡 | QB billing method — how to bill the 1st hour without looking like padding | Brett's model: $75 service charge covers the 1st hour, then $75 each additional hour. Ties to QB invoicing (B-001/B-015). From CAP-014. |
| B-056 | 🟡 | Change parcel-locker batteries — 3014 & 2930 | From CAP-016. |

| B-066 | 🟡 | Automate weekly EZ-Pass toll pull → auto-invoice Ray | Pull toll data weekly, generate + send invoice. From CAP-017. |
| B-067 | 🟡 | Re-itemize Cesar estimates into checklists; Cesar = major, Oscar = minor | Ties estimating B-030/031. From CAP-017. |
| B-068 | 🟠 | Create invoices for Federal St job (off-Hub) | ⚠ Job not in Maintenance Hub. From CAP-017. |
| B-069 | 🟠 | FU Fait Ave/St owner — collect payment + confirm no more leaks | From CAP-017. |
| B-070 | 🟢 | Fait Ave/St — replace 3rd-floor pop-up assemblies | Low priority; combine with other work unless owner wants sooner. From CAP-017. |
| B-071 | 🔴 | FU Vanity repair lead (FB) — time-sensitive | High priority; FB lead likely cooling, follow up ASAP. From CAP-017. |
| B-087 | 🟡 | Unified vehicle-notice router (tolls, violations, recalls, MVA/registration) — route by VIN/plate | Look up Holder in Fleet roster (B-090) → send + 5-day follow-up until confirmed; dedup vs already-sent; file under Vendors/manager. **Holder→email:** KingBee tolls=tolls@kingbee-vans.com, KingBee recalls/other=hive.network@kingbee-vans.com; Giddyup=info@giddyuprentals.com; Ray Lewis=accounting@lewisdrums.com + rlewis@lewisdrums.com; **LIEN (AUP135)=route to Brett**. NJ-van TOLLS = EZ-Pass exception. **MVA/registration notices: forward ONLY for KingBee vans; GiddyUp/Ray Lewis/LIEN → Brett resolves (no forward).** SEND MODE: drafts-for-review default + templated cover note stating the ask; auto-send later. Apps Script/Worker. From CAP-020/022, CAP-005. |
| B-090 | 🟠 | Fleet Vehicle roster sheet — VIN/plate → current holder (Kingbee/GiddyUp/Ray Lewis) | Backbone for the vehicle-notice router (B-087) + compliance/registration (CAP-005/006). Sheet `11HVkmGOKhTveAXGajs0_pTOkPaZk6HXxZmx1h2wz_nY` READ July 19 — has VIN, plate (MD Tag #), Holder (KingBee/LIEN/Ray Lewis/Giddyup). 8 vans + 2 Turo. Service account SHARED July 19 — **unblocked.** Remaining: normalize Holder values; holder→email map lives in router config (B-087). Ready to wire. From CAP-022. |

## RIDGE CO — ESTIMATING

| ID | Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-030 | 🟠 | Estimating template system — reusable proposal generator | Intake form (Sheet or structured input) → auto-generated HTML proposal. Base design on 4518 Fairfax Rd v1.1 as reference. ~2hr build session. |
| B-031 | 🟠 | Estimating skill/agent — scope intake, photo review, line item generation | Replace Gemini workflow. Ask questions, stick to provided scope, no invented items, build memory of Brett's pricing patterns. |
| B-032 | 🟡 | Proposal PDF export — one-click PDF with hyperlinks from HTML proposal | Chromium headless print-to-PDF. Links to Drive photos must survive. |

## BRETTOS INFRASTRUCTURE

| ID | Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-013 | 🟠 | Scheduled context update — auto-push session log after each session | GitHub Actions or Cowork scheduled task. Recurring reminder now set. |
| B-014 | 🟠 | QB refresh token auto-renewal monitoring | Alert Brett 2 weeks before 100-day expiry |
| B-016 | 🟡 | Multi-venture dashboard — one page, all ventures status | BrettOS homepage |
| B-017 | 🟡 | Agent builder — create reusable agents for common tasks | Cowork skill |
| B-018 | 🟢 | Automated session log append after every Cowork session | Claude writes session summary to BACKLOG + SESSION_LOG |
| B-033 | 🟡 | Best Practices doc update — no AI-obvious filenames, no PDF header/footer rule | Add as Section 14 to Brett_Cowork_Best_Practices_v1.3 → v1.4 |
| B-051 | 🟠 | Daily digest of next steps + small wins | Attach new entries to major projects; leave space for more entries (FU's, invoices). From CAP-015. |
| B-052 | 🟠 | Voice interface → spreadsheet (voice-to-sheet capture) | From CAP-015. |
| B-053 | 🟡 | Multi-step tags + categorization of captures | From CAP-015. |
| B-054 | 🟡 | Context/location-aware task surfacing | Suggest on-the-way / nearby / same-context tasks (@ Home Depot, waiting in line). Form-factor: phone-first vs desktop. From CAP-015. |
| B-059 | 🟡 | Link tasks → projects (capture layer) | Reinforces CAP-015 "attach entries to major projects." From CAP-017. |
| B-091 | 🟠 | Reconcile with the REAL BrettOS task app (sheet 1X2oYjD) — append net-new only, dedup | The BrettOS Tasks sheet already exists + holds ~25 of our items (bulk-pasted July 14). Append ONLY net-new (via sheet-ops); BrettOS sheet = canonical task home, repo = deep notes feeding it. From CAP-024/CAP-025. |
| B-092 | 🟠 | Fix BrettOS integration sync error (401) | **DIAGNOSED July 23 (via Cloudflare connector, read `brett-os` worker code).** `handleEntitiesSync` calls maintenance-hub `/public/entities-feed` sending `env.MAINTENANCE_HUB_SECRET` as `X-Auth-Token`. That var holds the **pre-July-20-rotation** secret → maintenance-hub 401s → logs error every 6h (scheduled() cron). **FIX (one field, needs Brett dashboard):** brett-os worker → Settings → Variables → set `MAINTENANCE_HUB_SECRET` = the CURRENT secret `mh-pbg5R2uGZUi52XyzDiMNned-27TashvL3ED62rEYiIg`. Barrelco feed call sends NO auth (separate; barrelco `atob` error is its own issue). From CAP-025. |
| SEC-1 | 🔴 | **Live API secret is committed in the PUBLIC repo** (elevates B-093) | The current maintenance-hub `WORKER_SECRET` (`mh-pbg5…`) is hardcoded in vendor.html/tenant.html/owner.html/customer.html/submit.html/building-info.html — i.e. anyone reading the public `Ridge-Co/RidgeCo` repo has full API access to the live Hub. Real vulnerability. Proper fix = per-user auth + move secret out of the repo (B-093 / Phase-0 security). Surfaced July 23 while fixing B-092. |
| B-074 | 🟡 | Lead-finder Chrome extension — scan FB posts needing repairs/lawn care, respond, exclude "I need it today" | From CAP-018. |
| B-081 | 🟡 | Lead capture that doesn't look bot/scammy/salesy | Cross-cuts B-074/B-080. From CAP-018. |
| B-089 | 🟢 | HSA receipt automation (future, personal) — upload receipts to HSA for reimbursement | Mirrors CAP-002 pipeline; receipts folder in personal Drive; provider upload may need browser automation. From CAP-021. |
| B-140 | 🟢 | **Staging/preview Worker lane** — autonomy prerequisite #1 (isolation) | ✅ **BUILT July 23** — SEPARATE Worker `maintenance-hub-staging` (chosen over a same-Worker preview because secrets are global + the `staging-` isolation code doesn't exist in worker.js). Deploys from Cloudflare auto-branch `update_worker_name_to_maintenance-hub-staging` (wrangler name=maintenance-hub-staging). Own secrets: SHEET_ID=staging sheet `16PCD3t…`, FRESH GOOGLE_SA_KEY (new key, same SA, prod key untouched), own WORKER_SECRET, NO QB. URL `maintenance-hub-staging.brett-2f8.workers.dev` — verified alive (401 on authed route). Prod `maintenance-hub`/main untouched; leftover `staging` branch neutralized. Pending: confirm it reads its sheet (via command-center `?staging`). Fixes rule 18. From CAP-029. |
| B-141 | 🟠 | **Smoke-test harness / self-check** — autonomy prerequisite #2 (self-verification) | 🟡 IN PROGRESS July 23: built a PUBLIC read-only `/health` endpoint (row counts per tab + `sheet_tail`; in PUBLIC_PATHS) on the staging branch so an agent can verify via WebFetch (my sandbox can't raw-curl out; WebFetch reaches the Worker). **SNAG:** pushes to the staging build-branch land as a Cloudflare *preview version*, not a deploy to the live staging URL → `/health` still 401s on `maintenance-hub-staging.brett-2f8.workers.dev`. FIX = set the staging Worker's **production branch = `staging`** in Cloudflare (Settings→Build→Branch control), then it `wrangler deploy`s. `/health` NOT on main/prod. Note: WebFetch caches 15min/URL — bust with `?cb=N`. Also: a fuller "staging sandbox mode" (STAGING_SHEET_ID + log-only SMS, fails-closed) existed in July-21 unmerged work but is NOT in current main worker.js. curl-assert suite still to build once `/health` deploys. From CAP-029. |
| B-142 | 🟠 | **ridgeco-validate skill** — autonomy prerequisite #3 (review gate) | Adversarial built-vs-brief validator; fixes nothing; mandatory for money/customer/auth. ✅ DELIVERED July 23 as `ridgeco-validate.skill`. Wire into brett-flow step 5.5. From CAP-029. |
| B-143 | 🟡 | **Autonomy ladder** — governing strategy doc | Blast-radius-gated: autonomy earned per-section by rails, never global; money/QB/customer/auth stay human-gated. Ties B-127/B-129. From CAP-029. |
| B-144 | 🟠 | **Quality Bar / Definition-of-Done rubric** — DEFINE (the quality parameter) | Per change-class "what good is" checklists; what validator+reviewer score against. Build first. From CAP-029. |
| B-145 | 🟠 | **Golden-path scenario tests + seeded fixtures** — TEST positively | End-to-end business-outcome assertions on B-140 preview against a test Sheet/tenant; also closes single-live-DB blocker. From CAP-029. |
| B-146 | 🟠 | **Quality-reviewer agent** — REVIEW (2nd lens beyond ridgeco-validate) | Multi-lens panel: correctness/security/SSOT/mobile/i18n/data-integrity. From CAP-029. |
| B-147 | 🟡 | **Quality KPIs into the Optimizer** — MEASURE | error rate, p95, QB drift, Brett-corrections/feature, EN/ES coverage → B-128/B-129. From CAP-029. |
| B-148 | 🟡 | **Canary rollout + automated rollback** — MEASURE/safety | flag/canary, watch KPIs N hrs, auto-rollback on breach; automates rule-18 rollback. From CAP-029. |
| B-149 | 🟡 | **House-style consistency checks** — REVIEW (no-framework linter) | auth helper, WO-by-header, QB_TRADE_MAP, standard error shape, Status SSOT. From CAP-029. |
| B-150 | 🟡 | **Quality-gate policy + Brett spot-checks** — CALIBRATE | merge thresholds by blast radius + 1-in-N human spot-review of auto-merged work. Ties B-143. From CAP-029. |
| B-151 | 🔴 | **Control Panel / COMMAND CENTER** — KEYSTONE (Brett can't read code) | Plain-English human surface all of B-144..150 report into + a **Today** home tab (open/important/next across ALL ventures — unifies B-016 + B-051). Brett = approver not inspector. ✅ v2 MOCKUP delivered July 23 (`brettos-control-panel.html`); awaiting feedback → live build. From CAP-029. |
| B-153 | 🟠 | **Priority engine + "Stalled & costing you"** — the panel's brain (CAP-030) | venture switch/filter + per-venture #1 next step + rank by who's-waiting+deadline+$ + blocked-&-bleeding tracker (Fleet↔BarrelCo). Renders in B-151. ✅ panel v3 delivered. From CAP-030. |
| B-152 | 🟠 | **Scoped sandbox for money paths** — extends B-140/B-145 | B-140+B-145 already ~70% cover it. Real gap = QB: mock by default + Intuit QB Sandbox company for money-path golden tests + hard "sandbox mode" flag (can't touch live Sheet/QB by construction). NOT test entities in live QB. Scope to money/QB/customer only. From CAP-029. |

## RIDGE CO — BIG BUILD QUEUE (planned July 22, 2026)
*Sequenced plan + testing strategy live in the July 21 build-plan doc. Consolidates the RidgeCo Main "Wishlist" tab (76 items) + these new asks. Priority: Ridge Co. Nothing ships without a test.*

**Locked decisions (July 21):** tomorrow = quick wins → security fix (per-user auth; **phone-only tenant login**) + fix the live 401 sync outage (B-092) → status-enum SSOT → Cron infra → Phase 1 notifications (**hold-SMS-til-8am**, email deferred). UI redesign = **Phase 4** (after engine stable).

| ID | Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-093 | 🟠 | Notification engine v2 — quiet-hours + hold-til-8am + test/admin mute + **channel-tiering** | Wrap the single `sendSMS` chokepoint (worker.js:1627): preference check, 8pm–8am ET quiet hours = **HOLD SMS til 8am via the notification queue + Cron**; test-mode + admin-mute (2hr auto-resume via Config flag). **Owner channel policy (Brett, July 22):** owner **SMS/push = milestones ONLY — Scheduled, Complete, On Hold (+reason)**; all other detail → **email** (re-enables the email channel for owners specifically; it stays deferred elsewhere). **Owner SMS is two-way** — an owner can reply with requirements → route the inbound to the WO notes + a Capture, and it IS the owner lane of the Ask agent (B-133). Milestones map to the Status SSOT (Scheduled=event; Complete; On Hold w/ reason; owner label mask applies). Generalizable pattern: status→SMS, detail→email, per role. Foundation for B-094/B-095. New asks + Wishlist #8/#32. |
| B-094 | 🟠 | WO-create vendor SMS opt-out checkbox (default OFF 8pm–8am ET) | Checkbox on new-WO/assign form; default off during quiet hours; suppresses the vendor-assign SMS (worker.js:703). Sits on B-093. |
| B-095 | 🟠 | Tenant + owner after-hours silent mode (hold SMS til 8am) | Same 8pm–8am ET quiet window; HOLD the SMS until 8am next-day via the notification queue + Cron. **Owner channel policy (July 22, see B-093):** owners get SMS for milestones only (Scheduled/Complete/On Hold+reason), detail via email, two-way replies routed to WO notes + B-133 owner lane. Sits on B-093. |
| B-096 | 🟠 | Split work order + dependencies | Parent/child WOs from one request; dependency chains (cleaner after painter). Greenfield (no split today). Wishlist #16. |
| B-097 | 🟠 | Vendor-triggered recurring WO w/ smart clock-reset | Vendor triggers next occurrence to attach a bill; reset the recurrence clock only if actual is close to schedule (13d on a 14d cycle = no reset; weekly on a biweekly = reset). Ties B-098. |
| B-098 | 🟠 | Recurring WO from template + seasonal windows | Template carries a default schedule (editable on template AND instance); recurs only between start/end dates (growing season; fall leaf cleanup). Needs Cron + recurrence model. Wishlist #33. |
| B-099 | 🟠 | Template-from-vendor trigger → mark-complete + QB, no SMS | Create WO from a template tied to a vendor on receipt of their bill (e.g. fire-extinguisher service); default Complete, suppress SMS, push to QB. |
| B-100 | 🟠 | Pre-triggered / dependency WOs (turnover cleaner) | Schedule a WO in advance tied to a move-out date and/or another WO; notify the assignee when the dependency (painter) completes; earliest-start = move-out. Wishlist #13/#63. |
| B-101 | 🟠 | Estimate approval with start-date + deadline | Approve estimate but earliest-start = +N days; add to calendar; vendor notice carries earliest-start + deadline disclaimer. Builds on approveEstimate (worker.js:1064). |
| B-102 | 🟡 | Hub UI redesign to the Fairfax-estimate design standard | Codify the 4518 Fairfax estimate look as the Hub design system (minimum standard, then elevate). Design-led track; do AFTER functional stability. Wishlist #23/#30/#57/#70/#75/#76. |
| B-103 | 🟠 | Email → Work Order intake engine (Buildium + manual lists) | Source-agnostic intake engine + pluggable parsers. Apps Script poller forwards new maintenance emails → new `POST /intake` in worker.js → detect source → parse → find-or-create Owner/Property/Unit/Tenant → pull photos (S3→Drive) → `createWorkOrder` with `Owner_WO_Ref` → notify admin (`onIntakeCreated` = auto-assign seam). v1 = engine + **Buildium parser** (deterministic, high-confidence, auto-create) + **manual-list AI parser** (Mark's free-text lists → new `Intake_Queue` tab + Hub review screen → `/intake/approve`). Keyword trade-guess (easily overridable). Dedicated `INTAKE_TOKEN`. Build on a **staging branch + test sheet** (see EMAIL_INTAKE_BUILD_BRIEF). Decisions locked July 21. Full plan: `RidgeCo_Email_Intake_Build_Plan_v1.0` + `context/EMAIL_INTAKE_BUILD_BRIEF_v1.0.md`. Phase D (auto-assign) + AppFolio parser = future. |

**Also — escalate B-092 (integration sync):** since the July 20 `WORKER_SECRET` rotation the BrettOS sync into maintenance_hub + barrelco is now **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** (was error 1042) — the sync caller still uses the OLD secret. Urgent quick-fix; ties the security work (Phase 0). Barrelco also throws an `atob()` base64 error (separate).


## JULY 21 CAPTURES (from Scanned_202607211020 + …1341 → CAP-027/028)

From CAP-027/028. |
| B-114 | 🟡 | Vendor text-message mining → info-gap surfacing | Pull vendor text threads to surface information gaps the WO system should capture; feed the dispatch/info-gathering flow. Ties B-044, B-113. From CAP-028. |
| B-115 | 🟡 | Vendor tools & equipment tracking | Track what tools/equipment each vendor has, for use as an auto-dispatch/assignment input. Ties CAP-010 + B-113. From CAP-028. |
| B-116 | 🟠 | Vendor availability & schedule preferences | Per-vendor: no weekends / no evenings / etc; block notifications during set hours + vacations; option to block all except part notifications; **defer assignment SMS to the next available day after a block**. **Directly extends the Phase-1 notification build (B-093/B-094)** — fold in there. From CAP-028. |
| B-117 | 🟡 | WO as shareable HTML + PDF + owner Drive download | Render work orders as an HTML site sendable as links or PDFs; downloadable into a Google Drive folder — WITHOUT exposing other-owner info. Ties B-011, B-032, privacy rule 13. From CAP-028. |
| B-118 | 🟡 | Z-Inspector app + inspection template (Phoenix Real Estate) | Build the **Z-Inspector app** + an inspection template for **Phoenix Real Estate** and tie into Ridge Co. Phoenix = client **Mark**'s company (Mark + assistant **Amanda** both have **owner** access on the Hub portal). From CAP-028. |
| B-119 | 🟡 | Ridge Co website + SEO | Public marketing site with SEO. From CAP-027. |
| B-120 | 🟡 | Winchester Hauling website + SEO | Public marketing site with SEO. From CAP-027. |
| B-121 | 🟢 | Ridge Co Facebook profile overhaul | Revamp the Ridge Co FB business profile. From CAP-027. |
| B-122 | 🟢 | BarrelCo — own Facebook group for barrels | Create Brett's own FB group for barrel sales (vs relying on existing yard-sale groups). Ties B-080, CAP-018. From CAP-027. |
| B-123 | 🟡 | Scheduled background agents on to-dos | Separate agents that run in the background on a schedule (overnight / off-peak) to act on Brett's to-do items — analyze + build. Operating directive, not just a feature; ties the "autonomous ops" goal + CAP-015 + "Second Brain" (CAP-028 #2). From CAP-028. |
| B-124 | 🟠 | **Scan Intake Agent** (first B-123 instance) | **Cadence: DAILY 12:00am ET** (changed from hourly July 21 — hourly full-session polls too costly; midnight run "gets things ready for the next day"). **Write behavior: auto-create live records, tagged "Unverified — from scan", and report each (Brett's choice July 21).** Scheduled task polling the handwriting Drive folder (`1iXjjwsnPKF_GtlR8gesxS9uJppO4xntZ`) for NEW scans (diff vs a processed-file ledger — connector can't move/rename, so track by file ID; a `Processed` subfolder exists but is manual-only). For each new scan: OCR → append handwriting-key improvements → split into (a) **ideas/tasks** → CAP/BACKLOG (today's manual flow, automated), and (b) **structured entity actions** → find-or-create **Property / Tenant / Owner / Work Order + lockbox code** via worker routes (`/property/add`, `/tenant/add`, `/owner/add`, `/workorder`, `/key/add`+`/key/update`). New WO w/ missing property → create the property first, tag ownership + tenant. Goal: a property record exists so Brett can attach WO photos/inspections on a site visit. **Reuses the B-103 source-agnostic `/intake` engine** as the "handwriting parser" (don't duplicate find-or-create). **Open blockers:** (1) headless credential availability — a scheduled fresh session may lack the Drive connector + the write path (WORKER_SECRET for worker calls; GitHub PAT for repo/sheet-ops); first fire self-tests + reports. (2) write-behavior decision (auto-create-tagged vs review-queue). From CAP-028 #7; ties B-123, B-103, B-055. |
| B-125 | 🟠 | **Hub quick-command bar** (voice/text → action) | A command box on the Hub dashboard (index.html) that takes **voice (Web Speech API on Android Chrome) or typed** free text and just executes: "create new property 123 Main St Baltimore MD with lockbox code 1234", "new work order at 928 N Calvert — no hot water", "update lockbox 1214 #3 to 4471", "new key/access code …". New `POST /command` worker route → LLM parse (worker already has an AI binding via `generateEstimateText`/`translateToEnglish`) → structured `{action, entity, fields}` → route to existing handlers (`/property/add`, `/workorder`, `/key/add`, `/key/update`, `/tenant/add`, `/owner/add`). New WO w/ missing property → create property first. Additive build (new route + new dashboard panel); reuses current WORKER_SECRET (will inherit Phase-0 auth later). Key/code updates are history-logged (`updateKeyWithHistory`) so "just do" is safe; creates are soft-deletable (Active flag). Shares the parse→action core with B-124 + B-103. From July 21 ask. |
| B-126 | 🟠 | **Owner billing + marked-up-estimate approval** | Owner portal (owner.html) currently has NO billing view at all. Add: **amounts + invoice link** per WO, and **estimate approval** — but the approvable estimate is the **marked-up, Brett-reviewed version** (Invoice_Review / customer-facing), **never the raw vendor estimate**. Flow: vendor estimate → Brett review + markup → surfaced to owner → owner approve/decline (feeds start-date + WO). Builds on B-030 (estimate template), B-101 (estimate approval + start-date), Invoice_Review markup. From Design Foundation v1.1 (decision #3, July 21). |

## HOW TO USE THIS BACKLOG

- **Brett says "do it"** → Claude moves item to In Progress, executes, moves to Completed
- **New idea comes up** → Claude adds it to backlog immediately with a priority
- **Something breaks** → Claude adds it to FEATURE_LOG regression rules after fixing
- **Session ends** → Claude updates Completed section with what was done
