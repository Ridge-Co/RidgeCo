# Current Context Files — Ridge Co / Brett AI

These are the authoritative files Claude must read at the start of every session.
Read ALL files before doing any work.

| Brett_Cowork_Best_Practices_v1.3.md | v1.3 | Session workflow, common mistakes, how to work with Brett |
| CREDENTIALS_MAP.md | v1.2 | Every service, auth method, secret location, access status. QB CONNECTED (prod); deploy pipeline reality |
| VENTURES.md | v1.0 | Every venture — current state, stack, Claude access level, automation gaps |
| FEATURE_LOG.md | v1.1 | What's working — check before every code change to prevent regressions |
| BACKLOG.md | v1.8 | Master backlog across all ventures — priorities, in progress, completed |
| CAPTURE_INBOX.md | v1.6 | Brett's zero-friction brain-dump inbox — CAP items, links to backlog, open questions. Read every session. |
| HANDWRITING_KEY.md | v1.7 | Reference for reading Brett's handwritten-note photos; grows over time. Seeded vocab + confirmed live reads from Scan_2019/2020/2030/2032/2104/2105_1/2105_2/2105. |

## How to update these files

When a new version is needed (new PAT, new project details, etc.):
1. Create the new versioned file (e.g., Brett_Context_Document_v1.9.md)
2. Update this CURRENT.md table to point to the new version
3. Push both files to GitHub
4. The old versioned file stays in /context/ as history — do not delete

| CREDENTIALS_MAP v1.2 + FEATURE_LOG v1.1 (engineering session) | July 19, 2026 | **BIG DAY.** (1) Fixed the silently-broken Cloudflare deploy — Worker hadn't auto-deployed in days; wired Workers Builds + `wrangler.toml` (keep_vars).
